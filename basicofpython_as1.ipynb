This usually occurs when combining different numeric types, such as integers and floats. For example, if you add an integer (5) to a float (2.5), Python will automatically convert the integer to a float before performing the addition, resulting in a float value (7.5). This kind of casting is safe and does not lead to data loss, as Python handles the conversion internally and ensures accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, explicit type casting is when the programmer manually converts a value from one type to another using built-in functions like int(), float(), or str(). This is useful when you receive data in one format (like a string from user input) and need it in another (like an integer for calculations). For instance, converting a string \"10\" to an integer using int(\"10\") allows you to perform arithmetic operations. However, explicit casting can result in data loss—for example, converting a float 3.7 to an integer using int(3.7) will result in 3, losing the decimal part."

The loop continues as long as the condition remains true, so you must manually update the variable that affects the condition; otherwise, it can lead to an infinite loop. For instance, a while loop can keep asking for user input until they enter a valid response. While for loops are ideal for iterating over elements, while loops are better suited for scenarios where the stopping point is uncertain."
